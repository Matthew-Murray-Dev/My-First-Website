		<h2>About Matthew</h2>
		<p>After graduating university with a bachelors in bioengineering I worked as a Research Associate on astronaut health research, then later in the field of prenatal health and cancer detection.  While I enjoy working in the lab and handling samples, I've recently taken interest in the ways computer programming can be used to solve problems both inside and out of the biotech industry.</p>
	<p>As a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful<a/>, I've began my journey to become a Software Developer.</p>
		<p> If you're looking to hire a new devloper with a background in Biomedical Engineering (or just looking for a new developer to join your team) please reach out!  I am very excited to work with other developers to solve problems and create great software.</p>
